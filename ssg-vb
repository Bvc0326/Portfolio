Sushma, 

For the past few months I've been waiting to ask you one thing. I waited till today (March 26), you will know the reason at the end.
Pinky, without my knowledge I got connected to you. 
When I am getting deeper in your thoughts, I couldn't stop myself thinking about you and seeing you.  So somehow I got you in Instagram.

I don't know if you have noticed or not, these days sometimes I am calling you even though there is nothing to talk, because I just wanted to talk to you and spend few minutes with you and that fills my day. 
Weekends are becoming so hard because I am getting feeling of missing you a lot without talking to you.

Can't wait to ask you this anymore Pinky, Will you marry me?

The main reason for waiting to tell you this today is, itâ€™s my birthday and I wanted to make this day more and more valuable.

If your answer is yes, I don't know how you are going to express, otherwise you can pretend like you never got this from me and I promise you that I won't bring this conversation anymore in between us.
I truly respect any decision that you are going to take and I am hoping that, this doesn't affect any of our professional relationship.

Finally, I have to tell you this, I will be the luckiest person, if you become part of my rest of the life.

With Love,
Vinay
